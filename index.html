           <h2>ABOUT</h2>  
            <p>I'm a passionate IT student with a strong foundation in computer science and software development. Currently pursuing my degree in Information Technology, I'm dedicated to learning cutting-edge technologies and building innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>My journey in tech started with curiosity about how software works, and has evolved into a deep appreciation for clean code, user experience, and problem-solving. I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end development, with a particular interest in web technologies and mobile applications.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new programming languages, contributing to open-source projects, or staying up-to-date with the latest tech trends. I believe in continuous learning and am always excited to take on new challenges.</p>
